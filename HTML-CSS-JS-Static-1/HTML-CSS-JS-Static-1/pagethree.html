  <h3>School</h3>
  
  <p title="hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia">At the moment, I'm a student in Fachschule Viventa, going through the
    BVJ Technik und Informatik.<br>
    A few things that I find particularly great about it is how we have 4 lessons of Informatik per week, as well as
    numerous lessons in different technical fields. <br>
    Addtiotnally, my German could use further improvement and here is just the place for that.
    I believe that I'll benefit quite a lot from this year and that it'll completely prepare me for my upcoming
    apprenticeship.

  <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
  <p title="the word you read is the phobia of long words">Outside of school, I like spending my time on going to the
    gym or taking rides on my bike. <br>
    I've also gotten into photography after purchasing a camera some months ago.<br>
    Last but not the least, I'd like to spend more time coding again this year as it is an acitivity I very much enjoy.
    I unfortunately didn't have a lot of time or energy for that due to how intensitve my previous school year was.

  <h3>IT Skills</h3>
  <p title="and I can prnounce it perfectly" style="margin-bottom:50px;">
    During my years here, I was able to gain quite a bit of programming experience, as well as more insight into what
    I'll protenitally be doing going down this line.<br>
    I partook in a Web-Development course where we designed our own websites and learned about <b>HTML</b> and
    <b>CSS</b>.<br>
    Simultaneously, I was visiting another course where we developed our own game with the help of <b>Unity</b>.<br>
    At the same time, I was learning <b>Python</b> at home, quite extensively at that.<br>
    A year later, I took on yet another course, this time focusing on developing our own Smartphone Apps with the help
    of an online tool called <b>Thunkable</b>.
    Last but not the least, my school required me to get better at using more basic programs such as <b>Word</b> and
    <b>PowerPoint</b>.
